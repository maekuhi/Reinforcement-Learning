## Exercise 2.1: In the $\epsilon$-greedy action selection, for the case of two actions and $\epsilon=0.5$, what is the probability that the greedy action is selected?

The probability of greedy action: $1-\epsilon$

The probability of random action: $\epsilon$

$P(\text{greedy})=P(\text{exploitation})+P(\text{exploration})$

$P=(1-\epsilon)+\epsilon\times \frac{1}{2} = 0.75$
